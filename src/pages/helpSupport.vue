    <p>    Welcome to the support and help page for our Quasar-based Progressive Web
    App (PWA) with chatting, media sharing, location sharing, login, and
    registration features. If you're having trouble using any of these features
    or experiencing technical difficulties, you've come to the right place.
    Below, you'll find a list of common issues and their solutions. Chatting
    Feature If you're having trouble sending messages, make sure you have an
    internet connection and that the recipient is online. If the chat feature is
    not loading or displaying messages, try refreshing the page or logging out
    and back in. If you're experiencing delayed message delivery, it could be
    due to poor network connectivity. Media Sharing Feature If you're having
    trouble uploading photos or videos, make sure they meet the size and format
    requirements specified in the app. If the media sharing feature is not
    loading or displaying uploaded content, try refreshing the page or logging
    out and back in. If you're experiencing slow upload speeds, it could be due
    to poor network connectivity. Location Sharing Feature If you're having
    trouble sharing your location, make sure your device's location services are
    turned on and that the app has been granted permission to access them. If
    the location sharing feature is not loading or displaying locations, try
    refreshing the page or logging out and back in. If you're experiencing
    inaccurate location data, it could be due to poor GPS signal or outdated map
    data. Login and Registration Features If you're having trouble logging in or
    registering, make sure you're using the correct username and password. If
    you've forgotten your password, use the "forgot password" feature to reset
    it. If you're experiencing issues with the registration process, make sure
    you're entering valid and complete information in all required fields. If
    you're still experiencing technical difficulties after trying the above
    solutions, please contact our support team for further assistance. You can
    reach us through the contact information provided in the app or on our
    website. Thank you for choosing our PWA, and we hope you enjoy using it! -
